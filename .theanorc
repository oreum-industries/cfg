config.compile.timeout = 1000
## JS NOTE at 2020-05-01 
## the cxx flag might be useful on e.g a Windows machine (G++, C++ Compiler)
## but by default theano uses clang on MacOS installed via xcode-select
## just for posterity, this is the link to g++ as installed by brew
## ALSO NOTE: using this generates an error: 
## """WARNING (theano.configdefaults): Only clang++ is supported. 
##    With g++, we end up with strange g++/OSX bugs."""
# cxx=/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/9.3.0_1/bin/g++-9
